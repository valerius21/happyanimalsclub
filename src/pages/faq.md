Here are some questions we are regularly contacted about.
If you need to contact us, please be so kind as to check these questions first.

## General Questions

> Where is the Happy Animals Club located?

The shelter is located in Matina, Davao City, Davao del Sur, on the island of Mindanao, southern Philippines.

> Can I visit the shelter?

We only have a skeleton staff and our schedule is fairly packed. For this reason, visits are by appointment only. Please contact us to make an appointment. Walk-in visitors will not be granted entry to the shelter premises.

> Do you have a Facebook page or a Twitter?

Yes, in September of 2015, we set up this Facebook page.

## Donating to the Shelter

> Would you like to receive goods such as blankets, dog toys, dog food, etc?

It is unfortunately a bit difficult to receive things, as the post office here (a) does not deliver, everyone has to go there to pick up their packages which often don't arrive, and (b) charges taxes and fees, even for presents.

> Can I send you dog food?

Please use the dog food to feed a stray dog or cat in your neighborhood, and, if possible, share the photos with us.

> Do you have a bank account other than UnionBank, such as BDO, BPI, Landbank?

Sorry, no!

## Adoptions

> What is the procedure for adopting an animal?

It varies from case by case, but the basic procedure is very simple. The adopter decides on an animal, and we then visit the adopter's home. There is no paperwork or documents required to be submitted or anything like that. To get started, please get in touch 09297264723

> What is the Adoption Fee?

There is no adoption fee, adoptions are free, with no hidden expenses or charges. We do not accept donations from adopters.

> I am in Luzon, can I adopt an animal?

You can but you have to come to Davao. If that's impractical, please adopt an animal from PART, PAWS, CARA, or some other rescue organization, of which there are many in Luzon.

> I am outside the Philippines, can I adopt an animal?

For now we are hoping to get the animals adopted within the country. Please adopt an animal from your local shelter instead!

## Media

> Can we do an interview with Ken?

Sure, just drop us a line. Our contact info is given below.

> Can we use your photos for our publication?

Sure, let us know if you need higher resolution images.

> Can Ken speak at our event? Be a guest of honor?

Ken is not doing the speaker circuit, sorry!

## Rescue Work

> Can I bring an animal to the shelter?

We're sorry but we cannot accept animals brought to the shelter. This includes animals owned by you, animals owned by third parties, and rescued animals. The reason is that we cannot do the work we do if we become a dumping ground for unwanted animals.

> Can you rescue my pet? Can you pay the veterinary bills of my pet?

We sorry, but we cannot take care of privately owned animals.

> I rescued an animal, can I bring it to the shelter?

No, we are very sorry but if you rescued an animal, that animal is your responsibility not ours. We are unable to receive animals rescued by others.

> Can I foster one of your animals?

Sure! Please get in touch with us. 09297264723

## Contact

> How can I get in touch?

Thank you for your letters of support! Unfortunately, between school, feeding animals on the street, and of course taking care of the animals at the animal shelter, Ken has very little free time. He uses the computer infrequently and rarely has time for email. If you have any questions or inquiries, comments or advice, please do get in touch with Happy Animals Club staff, but please note that Ken himself will not see your email. We are very sorry about this but beg for your understanding. You can reach the Happy Animals Club admin at happyanimalsclub [at] gmail [dot] com.
